# Traits

This library provides a mechanism to manage configuration values in JSON file(s). This library also supports using reflection to load assemblies based on configuration in the traits configuration file.

v1 supports basic configuration and loading providers by reflection entries in the traits.json file.
v2 extends v1 functionality by allowing reflection definitions to be stored in a separate reflection folder.
v3 project and file structure modified to further mirror Helix Architecture. Pipeline functionality migrated to foundation and functionality extended.
