<p>Traits description</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Traits is structure in a similar fashion to the Helix Architecture with a few changes.<br/>
<ul>
    <li>The projects node is called Apps as it will be storing a variety of application types</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Apps</h3>
<p>The <a href="./Apps/index.html">Apps</a> section stores folders with various applications. Each application will reference elements of the foundation and various features. Each application will contain its own documentation folder.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The <a href="./Features/index.html">Features</a> section contains libraries that extend the functionality of HubAI. A library is placed in the feature section if that library is not likely to be referenced by another HubAI Library.</p>

<h3>Foundation</h3>
<p>The <a href="./Foundation/index.html">Foundation</a> section contains the building blocks of HubAI. These libraries can reference each other but none of the libraries in the feature section</p>
