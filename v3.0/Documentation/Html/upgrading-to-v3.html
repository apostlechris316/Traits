<h1>Upgrading to Traits V3</h1>

<p>Breaking Changes</p>

<h2>Traits format</h2>

<p>There are various things to do for v3<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Traits currently loads storage providers statically it should use reflection.</li>
	<li>TraitsQuickStart.Foundation.Reflection BaseReflectionManager should include the loadobject etc to be used by the other reflection methods but also other places wanting to use reflection in a raw form supplying assemblyname and type and dllpath without the need for definition or traits entries</li>
</ul>
